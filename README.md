# Knight's Travails Project

The goal of this project is to implement a function #knight_moves that shows the simplest possible way to get from one square to another using a Chess Knight.
The function will output all squares the knight will move to on its way.

This is a project from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/ruby-programming/lessons/data-structures-and-algorithms).
